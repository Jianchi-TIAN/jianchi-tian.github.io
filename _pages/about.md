I am a PhD candidate from State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Science and Mental Health, [Institute of Psychology](http://english.psych.cas.cn/au/){:target="_blank"}, [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.cas.cn/){:target="_blank"} (CAS) and the Department of Psychology at [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/){:target="_blank"} (UCAS). I obtained my BS in Apllied Psychology in 2021 from [Nanchang University](https://english.ncu.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"} (NCU).

In the first three years of my doctoral program supervised by Prof.Yan Sun at IPCAS, I led a series of studies exploring pathways to enhance public support for climate policies and promote pro-environmental behaviors. My work primarily integrates psychological theory and communication strategies, with a particular focus on applying advanced statistical techniques, such as machine learning and psychological network analysis. Currently, my research is focused on designing innovative behavioral experiments aimed at simulating and predicting climate actions at the individual, group, and national levels. I am particularly interested in understanding how different communication strategies and policy interventions can be tailored to accelerate climate action across various contexts.

Now, I am looking for a postdoctoral research fellow position starting in 2026.
