I am a PhD candidate from the State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Science and Mental Health, [Institute of Psychology](http://english.psych.cas.cn/au/){:target="_blank"}, [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.cas.cn/){:target="_blank"} (CAS) and the Department of Psychology at [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/){:target="_blank"} (UCAS). I obtained my BS in Applied Psychology in 2021 from [Nanchang University](https://english.ncu.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"} (NCU).

My doctoral research centres on understanding and promoting public engagement with climate action and policy. I have led a series of studies examining pathways to improve public support for climate policies and to encourage pro-environmental behaviours. For example, my work integrates theories from environmental psychology with communication strategies, while employing advanced analytical techniques such as machine learning and psychological network analysis. I have also been responsible for projects assessing the environmental implications of AI and exploring how AI can be used to foster pro-environmental behaviour.

At present, my research focuses on the design of innovative behavioural game experiments that simulate and predict climate-related actions at the individual, group, and national levels. My specific research interests include:

I am currently seeking a postdoctoral research fellowship to begin in Autumn 2027.
